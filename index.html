    overview: 
      <section class="card">
        <h1>Overview of SDG 15</h1>
        <p>SDG 15, "Life on Land", is a broad goal that covers forests, biodiversity, desertification, land management, and more. A core component is preventing and reversing land degradation — the process that reduces the productive capacity of land.</p>

        <h2>Key indicators related to land degradation</h2>
        <p class="muted">Policy makers and scientists track indicators such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Proportion of land that is degraded over total land area.</li>
          <li>Forest area as a percentage of total land area.</li>
          <li>Trends in soil organic carbon and erosion rates.</li>
          <li>Biodiversity measures (species abundance, extinction risk).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Terminology</h2>
        <p><strong>Land degradation:</strong> decline in land quality caused by human activities and environmental factors, resulting in reduced productivity and ecosystem services.</p>
        <p><strong>Desertification:</strong> land degradation in arid, semiarid and dry sub-humid areas, often linked to climate variability and human pressures.</p>

        <h2>Scale and urgency</h2>
        <p>Globally, an estimated large area of land is degraded to some degree (estimates vary by methodology). Restoration and sustainable land management are cost-effective investments — improving food security, increasing carbon sequestration, and rebuilding resilience to droughts and floods.</p>

    causes: 
      <section class="card">
        <h1>Drivers & Causes of Land Degradation</h1>
        <p>Land degradation is typically caused by a combination of natural processes and human activities. Key causes include:</p>

        <h3>Agricultural practices</h3>
        <p>Intensive tillage, monocultures, overuse of chemical fertilisers and pesticides, removal of crop residues, and lack of crop rotation lead to soil structure loss, nutrient depletion, salinization and erosion.</p>

        <h3>Deforestation and land-use change</h3>
        <p>Clearing forests for agriculture, mining, or urban expansion destroys root systems and soil cover, increasing erosion and reducing water retention.</p>

        <h3>Overgrazing</h3>
        <p>When livestock densities exceed carrying capacity, vegetation cover is lost and soils become compacted and vulnerable.</p>

        <h3>Urbanisation and infrastructure</h3>
        <p>Sprawl, road building and land sealing reduce available productive land and change hydrology, increasing runoff and flood risk.</p>

        <h3>Unsustainable water management & irrigation</h3>
        <p>Poor irrigation can cause salinization and waterlogging; extraction of groundwater lowers water tables and affects ecosystems.</p>

        <h3>Climate change</h3>
        <p>Changes in precipitation patterns, prolonged droughts, and extreme weather events exacerbate degradation processes, especially in marginal lands.</p>

        <div class="callout">
          <strong>Interacting drivers</strong>
          <p class="muted">Often multiple drivers act together: e.g., deforestation increases vulnerability to drought, while overgrazing prevents recovery after extreme events.</p>
        </div>

    impacts: 
      <section class="card">
        <h1>Impacts of Land Degradation</h1>
        <p>Land degradation has cascading effects across environmental, social, and economic systems.</p>

        <h3>Food security & livelihoods</h3>
        <p>Reduced land productivity lowers crop yields and pasture quality, directly affecting farmers and pastoralists and increasing risks of poverty and migration.</p>

        <h3>Biodiversity loss</h3>
        <p>Habitat destruction and fragmentation eliminate niches and increase extinction risks for plants and animals.</p>

        <h3>Water cycle & climate</h3>
        <p>Degraded soils store less water and sequester less carbon, weakening climate resilience and increasing greenhouse gas concentrations.</p>

        <h3>Social stability</h3>
        <p>Resource scarcity can drive conflict, displacement and exacerbate inequalities — especially where land rights are insecure.</p>

        <h3>Economic costs</h3>
        <p>Restoration and lost productivity impose large economic costs. Conversely, investments in restoration yield high returns in ecosystem services.</p>

        <h3>Human health</h3>
        <p>Dust, reduced water quality, and decreased food availability have direct and indirect negative implications for health.</p>
      </section>
    

    solutions: 
      <section class="card">
        <h1>Solutions & Best Practices</h1>
        <p>Addressing land degradation requires integrated approaches at local, national and global scales. Key solution areas include:</p>

        <h3>Sustainable land management (SLM)</h3>
        <p>Practices such as conservation agriculture, agroforestry, cover cropping, reduced tillage, integrated pest management and landscape approaches help maintain soil health and productivity.</p>

        <h3>Restoration & rewilding</h3>
        <p>Active restoration (reforestation, assisted natural regeneration) and passive recovery in degraded areas rebuilds biomass, restores soil function and reconnects habitats.</p>

        <h3>Water-smart approaches</h3>
        <p>Rainwater harvesting, efficient irrigation (drip, micro-sprinklers), and watershed management reduce stress on water resources and prevent salinization.</p>

        <h3>Secure land tenure & inclusive governance</h3>
        <p>Clear land rights and community-led management incentivize sustainable investment in land, especially for indigenous peoples and smallholders.</p>

        <h3>Economic instruments</h3>
        <p>Payments for ecosystem services, carbon markets, sustainable supply chains and subsidies for good practices can shift incentives toward restoration and sustainable use.</p>

        <h3>Science, monitoring & technology</h3>
        <p>Remote sensing, soil monitoring, participatory mapping and early-warning systems allow targeted interventions and track progress toward SDG targets.</p>

        <h3>Cross-sector partnerships</h3>
        <p>Coordination between agriculture, environment, water and finance sectors amplifies impact. Private sector commitments (deforestation-free supply chains) can reduce drivers of degradation.</p>

        <div style="margin-top:12px">
          <h3>Practical farmer-level checklist</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Keep soil covered with residues or cover crops.</li>
            <li>Use crop rotations and integrate legumes to rebuild soil N.</li>
            <li>Reduce tillage where feasible.</li>
            <li>Integrate trees and hedgerows (agroforestry).</li>
            <li>Adopt targeted, efficient irrigation.</li>
            <li>Document and protect local seed and crop diversity.</li>
          </ul>

    policy: 
      <section class="card">
        <h1>Policy, Targets & Global Efforts</h1>
        <p>Global frameworks and national policies are crucial to scale up action:</p>

        <h3>UN frameworks</h3>
        <p>SDG 15 sits within the 2030 Agenda; other related frameworks include the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).</p>

        <h3>National strategies</h3>
        <p>Countries adopt national action plans, restoration targets (e.g., Bonn Challenge) and integrate land management into NDCs (Nationally Determined Contributions) under the Paris Agreement.</p>

        <h3>Finance and investments</h3>
        <p>Mobilising finance — public, private, blended — is essential. Examples: green bonds, restoration funds, climate finance for land-based mitigation and adaptation.</p>

        <h3>Monitoring progress</h3>
        <p>Robust monitoring (combining remote sensing and ground-truthing) and transparent reporting are essential to evaluate interventions and meet SDG targets.</p>

    cases: 
      <section class="card">
        <h1>Case Studies</h1>
        <p>Real-world examples showing both challenges and successful responses.</p>

        <h3>1. The Sahel (West Africa) — Regreening</h3>
        <p>Community-driven initiatives such as Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration (FMNR) have restored tree cover across degraded landscapes, improved soil fertility and crop yields, and increased resilience to drought.</p>

        <h3>2. China — Loess Plateau Restoration</h3>
        <p>Large-scale restoration of the Loess Plateau combined terracing, reforestation and sustainable livelihoods programs, turning severely eroded land into productive landscapes and reducing sediment in rivers.</p>

        <h3>3. Costa Rica — forest recovery through policy</h3>
        <p>Payments for ecosystem services and strong forest protection policies contributed to notable forest recovery and biodiversity benefits.</p>

        <h3>Lessons learned</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Locally led approaches that build on traditional knowledge are often more durable.</li>
          <li>Combining ecological restoration with livelihood support prevents perverse outcomes.</li>
          <li>Long-term monitoring and adaptive management are essential.</li>
        </ul>
